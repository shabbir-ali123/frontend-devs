The following images should be added to this directory for the dashboard to work properly:

1. team1-logo.png - Logo for the first team (left side)
2. team2-logo.png - Logo for the second team (right side)
3. field-bg.webp - Soccer/football field background image
4. stars.webp - Stars pattern for background
5. avatar.png - Small icon for history stats

You can use placeholder images from services like https://placehold.co/ or create your own.
For example: https://placehold.co/100x100?text=Team+1

The dashboard is designed to gracefully handle missing images with fallbacks.
